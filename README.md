## Overview of Project

### Purpose
- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
Finally, add these visualizations for a final presentation to pitch to investors.

### Background
To convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.

Start station map, shows that the bikes are used more in the downtown and midtown. 


### Analysis
- Regarthless of the gender, Citi bikes are used during working days to move in the busiest area of NYC (downtown and midtown). We can assume that Citi bikes are an alternative that citizens use for mobility in NYC, before and after their work. 
- Additionally, the best time to do any kinf of maintenance should be done between 1AM and 5AM, because less users are using the Citi bikes. 
- It would be interesting to know why thursday and friday are the busiest days, but other kind of data is needed for this analysis.
